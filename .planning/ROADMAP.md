# Roadmap: ChainJournal

## Overview

ChainJournal's roadmap transforms the vision of accurate automatic trade import into a working SaaS platform. Starting with essential authentication and Solana trade import, we progress through core journaling and analytics features, then add subscription management to complete the MVP. Each phase delivers a coherent capability that users can verify, building toward the goal of giving crypto traders professional-grade analytics and journaling tools.
